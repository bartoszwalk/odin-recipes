Attempt at TOP recipe website 

All the skills I've learnt in html and using git will
be put to the test in this short little project.

I'll be making a simple website with a focus on high-protein meals.

The following is a reflection:

I spent the most time looking back through the course material finding what exactly I needed to do what I wanted and not just aimlessly reading back. This shows me that it's just a matter of practice before it becomes second nature to me. I also enjoyed coming back to add a hint of css styling which I learned in the section after. The theme was something I have a personal interest in which made it even better seeing it all come to life and I think it's a good start.
